# Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack engineer with over a decade of experience bringing products to market at startups. I am passionate about creating useful tools for users, finding ways to build features quickly without compromising code quality, and making my colleagues more effective. My colleagues have said I'm skilled at debugging, code reviews, problem solving, planning, coaching, mentoring, and coming up with efficient, flexible, nuanced technical solutions.
